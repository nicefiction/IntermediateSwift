/**
 In the last video we refactored our type
 to store an actual `Date` object
 instead of a `String` representing a date .
 Stringly typed code is really bad .
 By eliminating room for error
 — particularly when using the date —
 we will have much safer code .
 There are still other properties that are unnecessary represented by primitive type
 when we could do much better .
 At the moment we are decoding and storing the url as a `String` .
 
 `let url: String`
 
 But ultimately — when we use the information —
 we will want that to be a URL where we can fetch additional data from .
 Fortunately we don’t really have to do any work here
 because URL encoding and decoding works right out of the box .
 All we need to do , is , change the stored property’s type
 — so the type on the URL property here —
 to the native `URL` instead of `String` .
 And the decoder should handle the rest with no additional work :
 */

struct Book: Codable {

   let title: String
   // let url: String
   let url: URL
   let publishDate: Date
}

/**
 Okay , so just remember ,
 when implementing `Codable` for your own types .
 Don’t store URLs and dates as strings .
 With very little additional work ,
 the decoder can handle the work of converting this information
 into a more type safe representation ,
 leaving you with safer code.
