 `4 Weak References` PART 2 OF 3

/**
 Before we conclude our discussion on memory management ,
 let's dip our toes back into protocols .
 As we have just seen ,
 some properties need to be declared as `weak`
 to prevent reference cycles in our code .
 We also learned
 that we can use a protocol
 to _enforce design_ in our concrete types .
 _Now what if those two goals collide ?_

    var tenant: Person? { get set }
    // weak var tenant: Person? { get set } // ERROR : 'weak' cannot be applied to a property declaration in a protocol .
}

/**
 And now ,
 the `Apartment` class needs to conform to the `Residence` protocol .
 If we add conformance now , ...

    var name: String

/**
 ... we don't have any errors either ,
 and therein lies the problem .
 I want to be able to enforce that
 because when someone creates a new type
 that conforms to `Residence` ,
 the `tenant` property must be `weak` .
 `DEPRECATED` :
 Fortunately we can do that back in the `Residence` protocol .
 We can simply add the `weak` keyword in the property declaration :
 */

/* DEPRECATED CODE :
 
 protocol Residence {
     
     weak var tenant: Person? { get set } // ERROR : 'weak' cannot be applied to a property declaration in a protocol .
 }
 */

/**
 Now this only works
 if the type of the property is a reference type .
 So here `Person` is a reference type :
 
 `class Person { ... }`
 
 This makes sense ,
 because you can only hold a weak reference to a reference type .
