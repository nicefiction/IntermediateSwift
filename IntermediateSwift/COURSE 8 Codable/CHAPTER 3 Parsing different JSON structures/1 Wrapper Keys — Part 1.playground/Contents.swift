 `Parsing Different JSON Structures`
 Now that we know how to use `Codable`

 to JSON
 let's work through several examples .
 In these examples
 we will encounter some of the various ways JSON is structured

 `1 Wrapper Keys`: PART 1 of 3
 INTRO ‚Äî Often times
 the JSON data we desire to populate our model
 is not represented at the top level of the object

 In this video
 we look at different strategies for decoding and encoding
 when we encounter wrapper keys .

/**
 Now that we know how to do some basic encoding and decoding ,
 let's look at a few situations that you will run into often ,
 and see how you can tackle them .
 Let's start with `wrapper keys` .
 _Now , what do I mean by that ?_
 I worked with the `Goodreads API` recently .
 Goodreads is a social website for everything book and reading related .
 And while their `API` actually returns `XML` ,
 it is formatted something like this
 ‚Äî if it were in `JSON` :

/**
 When you search for a book ,
 instead of getting a list of results back ,
 each result is wrapped .
 I have defined in here a snippet of this resulting JSON
 and what it could possibly look like .
 In all the snippets of JSON we have seen so far ,
 the data was just represented as a `dictionary` at the top level
 and we used keys to get to what we want .
 Here , however ,
 the data that we want is inside this `nested dictionary` .
 The key work wraps around the result info that we want .
 Now in this query , I have hit the search end point
 and I am looking for Ender's Game .
 We get a bunch of results back ,
 and each of those results is wrapped in this `work key` .
 We don't really care about this `work key` though .
 We just want the stuff that is inside .
 So let's look at how we can model this .
 Since the data represented inside `work` is a result of sorts ,
 I have defined a model down here called SearchResult :
 */

// struct SearchResult {}

/**
 For now ,
 we'll leave the information inside `best_book` .
 So if we go back to the JSON ,
 you'll see that there's `"work"` .
 Then you have an `"id"` ,
 `"books_count"` ,
 `"ratings_count"` ,
 `"text_reviews_count"` ,
 and then finally there is a further nested dictionary called `"best_book"` .
 We are going to leave that out for now ,
 and we'll just focus on getting this data into the model first .
 But we'll get to that , don't worry .
 Now , since all these properties on the model are primitive types ,
 we can conform to `Codable` with no issues :
 */

struct SearchResult: Codable {
    
    let id: Int
    let booksCount: Int
    let ratingsCount: Int
    let textReviewsCount: Int
}

/**
 Next , we have a decoder ,
 */
let decoder: JSONDecoder = JSONDecoder()
/**
 And here , I have indicated that the keys in the JSON are in SnakeCase  ,
 */
decoder.keyDecodingStrategy = .convertFromSnakeCase

// let searchResult = try decoder.decode(SearchResult.self , from : json)

/**
 If we try and decode this in the same way that we have been doing so far ,
 it will fail ,
 */

/**
 The reason it is failing here , is ,
 because the outer dictionary in the JSON ,

 `let json = """`
 `{`
     ‚òòÔ∏è`"work" : {`
         `"id" : 2422333,`

         `}`
     `}`
 `}`
 `""".data(using: .utf8)!`
 
 does not map to the model directly .
 The wrapper key gets in the way .
 The trick ‚Äî so to speak ‚Äî to getting this to work , is ,
 to understand that we need to ask the `decoder`
 to decode the JSON in exactly the same way
 as it is represented in the structure here
 ‚Äî which is a dictionary .
 Where the `key` is a `String`
 
 `"work"`
 
 and the `value` is a nested dictionary
 
 `"id" : 2422333 ,`
 `"books_count" : 222 ,`
 `"ratings_count" : 860687 ,`
 `"text_reviews_count" : 37786 ,`
 `"best_book" : {`
     `"id" : 375802 ,`
     `"title" : "Ender's Game (Ender's Saga, #1)" ,`
     `"author" : {`
         `"id" : 589 ,`
         `"name" : "Orson Scott Card"`
     `}`
 `}`
 
 that can be decoded into our type .
 So if we change our decoder request
 ‚Äî our decode request to match that representation ‚Äî
 by saying ,
 instead of saying directly `SearchResult.self` , ...
 */

// let searchResult = try decoder.decode(SearchResult.self , from : json)
/**
 ... if we say `String` to `SearchResult` , as a `Dictionary` , ...
 */

let searchResult = try decoder.decode([String : SearchResult].self ,
                                      from : json) // ["work" : {id 2422333 , booksCount 222 , ratingsCount 860687 , textReviewsCount 37786}]

/**
 ... now our code compiles ,
 and we have managed to decode the JSON .
 From here ,
 we can extract the value to `SearchResult`
 ‚Äî which is a value in this dictionary ‚Äî using the `key` .
 
 `// ["work" : {id 2422333 , booksCount 222 , ratingsCount 860687 , textReviewsCount 37786}]`
 
 This is not ideal , though .
 The value we care about
 is wrapped inside the dictionary .
 And because of how Swift dictionaries work ,
 this means unwrapping
 to actually get to a value we know is there .
 We could `map` over the resulting dictionary
 and return the value .
 But because the compiler does not know
 how many key value pairs the dictionary contains ,
 the result is now an array of search results .
 So , if I were to say `map()` ,
 */

let result = try decoder.decode([String : SearchResult].self , from : json).map {
    return $1 // returns SearchResult
}

/**
 which ‚Äî `$1` ‚Äî represents the value ,
 we now have a `SearchResult` type ,
 but when you OPTION click on `result`
 you will see that `result` is an array of `SearchResult` .
 So , from here , we would have to call first ,
 
 `result.first`
 
 which returns an optional ,
 so not good , right ? This isn't a great approach .
 _What else can we do ?_
