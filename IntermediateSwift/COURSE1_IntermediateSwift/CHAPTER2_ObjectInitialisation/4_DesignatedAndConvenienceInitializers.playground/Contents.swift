/**
 `4 Designated and Convenience Initialisers`
 INTRO — The initialisers we have been writing so far
 are more formally called
 designated initialisers
 and serve as the main point of instantiation for an object .
 In this video
 let's take a look at the difference between
 convenience and designated initialisers .
 */
/**
 Unlike initialisation in value types ,
 where only the types properties have to be initialised .
 Initialisation in a reference type
 involves
 assigning initial values to both
 ( 1 ) the classes stored properties ,
 as well as ( 2 ) any properties inherited from its super or base class .
 This makes things a bit more complex .
 Classes in Swift have two different types of initialisers
 to help ensure that all stored properties have initial values
 ( 1 ) designated initialisers
 and ( 2 ) convenience initialisers .
 
 
 `1. DESIGNATED INITIALIZERS`
 
 • Central point of initialization .
 • Classes must have at least one .
 • Responsible for initializing stored properties .
 • Responsible for calling super init .
 
 A designated initialiser is the primary initialiser for the class
 and the one that is responsible for
 assigning values to its stored properties
 and then calling the appropriate superclass initialiser
 to continue initialisation up the chain .
 The initialisers we have been writing for our classes all along
 have been designated initialisers .
 Designated initialisers are the central point of initialisation .
 So typically classes only have one ,
 in fact they must have at least one .
 Classes cannot exist without a designated initialiser ,
 but you already knew this
 because we get an error if we don't define an init( ) method .
 We just weren't calling it a designated initialiser .
 Let's take a look at an example now :
 */
class Vehicle {
    
    var name: String
    
    
    init(name: String) {
        
        self.name = name
    }
}
/**
 We have created a class named Vehicle .
 Vehicle is going to be pretty bare bones ,
 and we'll just give it a stored property to keep track of a name .
 Now classes need init( ) methods ,
 in fact they must have at least one designated initialiser ,
 so we have added one ,
 `init(name: String) { self.name = name }`
 This is a designated initialiser , and as you can see ,
 the syntax is just writing a normal init( ) method
 like we have been used to .
 
 
 `CONVENIENCE INITIALIZER`
 
 The second kind of initialiser we have , is , a convenience initialiser .
 Convenience initialisers are secondary ,
 supporting initialisers for a class
 — like we wrote an initialiser that delegates to the primary one in a value type
 namely the struct rectangle in the last video —
 a convenience initialiser can call a designated initialiser
 from within the same class
 with some of the parameters set to a default value .
 Now , just to highlight that point ,
 a convenience initialiser can only call a designated initialiser
 that is defined
 in the same class .
 Let's write it in just a second ,
 but before that ,
 it is worth pointing out
 initialising our class ,
 currently always requires a name .
 Let's pretend that this name property is not the car's brand name ,
 but something we affectionately name our car .
 Now , not everyone does this ,
 so it can be cumbersome to call the designated initialiser every time

 We get this error
 and that is because in a convenience initialiser
 you need to call your designated initialiser first
 before you can assign any values to stored properties .

 instead of doing this ...

/**
 When creating an instance of this class Vehicle ,
 `Vehicle()`
 we can use the convenience initialiser just like a normal initialiser
 and it recognises it .
 
 There we go ,
 as you can see the instance was created.
 Convenience initialisers aren't required , that sort of implied ,
 they are just initialisers that we can write for a convenience use cases .
 But that was a simple case ,
 where we only had to worry about a single class ,
 what happens if we have a superclass chain ?
 Let's find out.
 Onto the next video.
