 `2 Naming Types`
 INTRO — Some of the simplest rules are those
 that govern the naming of types .
 The names that we give our types
 provide a good deal of information
 about what the types do
 and in this video
 we look at several conventions .

/**
 When it comes to naming types ,
 there are just a few simple rules we need to follow ,
 most of which we have been doing all along .
 So , let’s bring it all together .

 — not just when naming types — but naming in general ,
 have a high level goal of
 naming things according to their role .
